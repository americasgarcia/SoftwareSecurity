My role was to look at Artemis Financial's system for vulnerabilities, fix weak spots in the code, so that the data would stay protected. The main issue was making sure sensitive information couldn't be intercepted or tampered with. 
I broke down the vulnerabilities and figured out which solutions made sense in the real world. Instead of trying to reinvent security, I leaned on proven practices like AES-256 encryption and SHA-256 hashing. That gave me confidence that the fixes I made were strong and dependeble. Coding securely matters because one mistake could put a company's data, and reputation at risk. Having secure software builds trust, which is very important for a financial business. 
The challenging part was setting up and testing HTTPS with certificates. Getting that running smoothly in a dev environment took some trail and error, but it pushed me to really understand how transport layer security works. On the flip side, using OWASP Dependency Check was very helpful since it gave me a clear picture of risks hiding in third party libraries, which is something I'll definitely use again. 
I added extra security layers by enforcing HTTPS, using cryptographic hashing for file integrity, and making sure passwords would be stored with adaptive hashing instead of simple hashes. If I was doing this in the future, I'd rely even more on automated tools like SAST/DAST scans to catch vulnerabilities and guide which mitigation strategies to use. After refactoring, I double checked everything by running the service, testing the /hash endpoint, and confirming the HTTPS setup was working as expected. I also re-ran dependency scans to make sure I didn't create new issues while fixing the old ones. That gave me peace of mind about the code not only being functional but also secure. 
The biggest lifesavers were the built-in Java crypto libraries and Spring Boot's HTTPS configuration. OWASP Dependecy Check was another tool I'll keep using because it makes supply chain risks a lot less overwhelming. 
What I like about this project is that it shows more than just code, it shows I can think about security from multiple angles. I can show encryption, authentication, and testing, which can now highlight my ability to handle both the technical and security-focused sides of development.
